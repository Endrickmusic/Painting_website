        <h1>About Painting</h1>
        <p>
          Hailed as “the greatest new band in the German pop avant-garde” by
          Rolling Stone, Painting are Theresa Stroetges (vocals, bass, guitar,
          synthesiser), Christian Hohenbild (vocals, drums, electronics) and
          Sophia Trollmann (vocals, saxophone, synthesiser). Stroetges and
          Hohenbild previously performed together in the band Soft Grid, while
          Trollmann contributed saxophone to one of Stroetges’s solo albums
          under her Golden Diskó Ship moniker.

          Formed in 2020, they have an unconventional setup which sees all three
          members share vocals (with Stroetges most often taking the lead) as
          well as swap instruments frequently. Drawing on a expansive and
          explosive palette ranging from experimental rock and electronic
          avant-garde sounds to leftfield pop and jazz, Painting Is Dead is a
          constantly shifting and refreshing kaleidoscope of sounds that feels
          like its fighting to escape the rigid confines of conventional
          songcraft. That struggle is mirrored in the songs’ themes, and lyrics
          pushing back against the binary forces that shape the lives of women
          and especially queer bodies in patriarchal society. From ‘Symmetrical
          Pattern’, with its canon-like opening sequence in which three voices
          reflect upon how heteronormative structures determinate the
          relationship between two people (“For reasons of convenience / We have
          settled into this / Symmetrical pattern”), to the electrifying ‘All My
          Eggs Go Down the Drain’, which addresses the expectations heaped upon
          those thought responsible for human reproduction, Painting Is Dead
          explores systems of subjugation while also making clear demands. “We
          need a new framework,” they sing, “And for this framework / We need a
          new skin”.

          The band collaborated with artist Paula Reissig to create walk-through
          3D Games for each song on the album – all of which can be played for
          free at paintingin3d.com.

          Brand new music from Painting will be released on Sinnbus and Lost Map
          Records in April 2025.

          the moment is the Berlin based trio Painting." Rolling Stone 07/22
